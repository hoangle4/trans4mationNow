                I was not going to see my grandbaby be a statistic’:
                Grandparents stepping up amid the opioid crisis in Ohio
              </strong>
              <br />
              CLEVELAND, Ohio – Thousands of people in Ohio have died from
              opioid overdoses in the last ten years. According to the Centers
              for Disease Control in 2017, 4,293 people died as a result of
              overdoses involving prescription and synthetic opioids and heroin.
              The massive number of deaths has left thousands of children
              without their parents. Some are put into foster care, but in many
              cases grandparents are stepping up to take responsibility. Mildra
              Kelly, 65, lives in Cleveland and is raising her 13-year-old
              grandson, Brian

                Grandparents Advisory Council Created by Brown's Supporting
                Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act Holds First Meeting
              </strong>
              <br />
              <strong>Wednesday, September 11, 2019</strong>
              <br />
              WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is applauding
              news that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
              Administration for Community Living (ACL), held the first
              Grandparents Advisory Council meeting last week. Brown’s
              Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act was signed into
              law last year and created the council in light of the addiction
              crises, which has forced many grandparents and other family
              members to step in and raise children whose parents are unable to
              care for them. The council met last week to discuss the needs of
              grandparents raising children and develop strategies on how
              federal agencies can best serve them.

              <strong>Maya Angelou talks about grandparenting</strong>
              <br />
              <strong>” I loved my grandmother.”</strong>
              <br />
              The memories flow out of Maya Angelou’s words like sweet molasses.
              It’s a tale she’s told before — in her groundbreaking work, I Know
              Why the Caged Bird Sings (Random House). But now, at 80, Angelou,
              originally from Stamps, Ark., is a grandmother twice over. Her
              son, Guy Johnson, is father to Colin Ashanti Murphy-Johnson, 32,
              and Elliott Jones, 22. She’s also a great grandmother — Colin has
              two children, Caylin Nicole Johnson, 11, and Brandon Bailey
              Johnson, 9. Angelou talked to Grandparents.com about her own
              grandmother’s legacy and how it shaped her thoughts about
              grandparenting.
